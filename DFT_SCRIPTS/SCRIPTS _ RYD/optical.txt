Dear Majibul,
To calculate the absorption spectra of a structure using Quantum Espresso, you have some options.
The simplest approximation is Independent Particle Approximation (IPA) which allows us to describe single-particle excitations. For this purpose, first, perform a self-consistent field ground-state calculation for your structure using the pw.x code. Next, perform a calculation of the absorption spectrum using the epsilon.x code.
***************************************
comands:
1- pw.x < scf.in > scf.out
2- epsilon.x < epsilon.in > epsilon.out
***************************************
The code epsilon.x produces four files:
epsr.dat – Real part of the dielectric function
epsi.dat – Imaginary part of the dielectric function
eels.dat – Electron energy loss spectrum
ieps.dat – Response computed on the imaginary axis of frequency
Finally, you can calculate the absorption spectrum of your structure with the Real and Imaginary parts of the dielectric function.
There is also another method. The turbo_davidson.x program allows us to calculate the absorption spectra of molecules using time-dependent density functional perturbation theory (TDDFPT). For more information visit the website below.
